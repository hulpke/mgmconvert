Permission is given to use this code as open source for purposes of
helping with the translation of Magma code to GAP, but not for translation
into other languages.


Commands:

MagmaConvert(magmafile[,gapfile]) 

translates a magma file into GAP-style code. the resulting code will need
manual reworking. If no gapfile is given output is to Stdout.. If no gapfile
is given output is to Stdout.



Project(directory,packagename))

assumes that directory is a folder that has a subfolder `magma' (containig
the magma code) and `translate' (for output). All files in the source folder
are read in , output is written the translate folder. Functions are assumed
to be local to the package (using the packagename identifier addition) and
function calls of package functions are modified accordingly.
The function returns a list that for each file gives all its dependency
files within the package.
